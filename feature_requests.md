# qr slide with information
each slide could have a tiny qr code with information about what and where to find it on the slide
this requires calibration of the slide and also very accurate precicion but it is a very nice idea

# force transmission counteracting cable drive system with aramid fishing line
instead of a rubber tire which moves the sliders with friction there could be some kind of counteracting cable drive system with aramid fishing line
this is a very interesting idea. i still think the 'rubber tire / rubber sealing ring' is much more accessible and easier to install. i prefer a solution that can be sourced as easily as possible. but of course the cable drive is indeed interesting and has advantages
