Stepper Motor 5V 1/64 (28BYJ-48)
This unipolar stepper motor is perfect for small craft projects with motors. The stepper motor can be easily connected via a plug connection to a stepper motor driver module. In our shop, we have various stepper motor drivers (ULN2003) on offer that fit this motor. The stepper motor has a gearbox with a ratio of 1:64 this gear ratio has a certain deviation. If the motor is always turned in the same direction, for example in a clock, a fault can occur. This fault can be compensated if the position is sporadically determined anew with a light barrier module. This also has the advantage that the start position of the stepper motor can be precisely determined when it is switched on for the first time.
